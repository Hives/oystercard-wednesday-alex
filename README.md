The error we encountered in step 03 was:
  NameError:
  uninitialized constant Oystercard
# ./spec/oystercard_spec.rb:1:in `<top (required)>'

This tells that type of error was NameError: unitialized constant, that happened in our spec file for oystercard on line 1.

It means that we haven't the object we're referencing.

One way we could solve this is to create the a file in lib called oystercard with the class Oystercard.
